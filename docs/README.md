## üíª Usage

To use this library you can import the `modulino` module along with the desired classes which give you access to the different modulinos. For example:

```python
from modulino import ModulinoPixels

pixels = ModulinoPixels()
```
Once the desired object is obtained you can call functions and query properties on these objects such as `pixels.set_all_rgb(255, 0, 0)`.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Using 3rd Party Boards

When using this library on a non-Arduino board, the I2C bus must be initialized manually.
Usually the available I2C buses are predefined and can be accessed by their number, e.g. I2C(0).
If not, the pins for SDA and SCL must be specified. An example on how to do this can be found [here](../examples/third_party_board.py).

## üëÄ Examples

The following scripts are examples of how to use the Modulinos with Python:
